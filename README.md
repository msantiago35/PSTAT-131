# PSTAT-131
Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning

This is my work in PSTAT 130 at UCSB. 
This course explores Statistical Machine Learning to discover patterns and relationships in large data sets using  concepts, methods and data analysis in R. 
Topics will include: data exploration, classification and regression tress, random forests, clustering and association rules. 
We build predictive models focusing on model selection, model comparison and performance evaluation.
